# Sinusoid

* Visualize sinusoid waves
* Combine Sinusoid waves
* Have fun playing with waves, just don't drown

## Equations
#### Format
Provide your equations as a function of time _`t`_
    `f(t) = A * sin( B * (t + C)) + D`

*where:*
* A = amplitude
* B = 2.PI.T
* C = Phase angle
* D = y - shift for non zero centered wave

#### Notations
* `*`      = Product
* `/`      = Division
* `+`      = Addition
* `-`      = subtraction
* `sin(x)` = sine of x
* `cos(x)` = cosine of x
